## How to use ðŸ”§

Requirements

- A computer with windows or Linux
- ODB to USB adapter

<br/>

To use it, insert the OBD connector into the appropriate slot, which is usually located in a compartment beneath the steering wheel. Plug the other end (USB) into the PC, launch the program, and it will automatically attempt to connect. After a brief loading time, if everything has been done correctly, you will see the main screen, where you will be able to both view and reset the car's DTCs.
